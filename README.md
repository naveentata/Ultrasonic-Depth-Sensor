# Ultrasonic-Depth-Sensor
In this project we have used ultrasonic sensor to measure the water level in the tank.
If water level is less than the threshold it can notify the user with mail using IFTTT.
A Circular Buffer is also implemented to take the a buffer of 10 values from sensor.
Used Thingspeak for monitering the water depth in the tank time to time.
